What's the point of learning something if you can't remember it?   
If you can't remember something, can you really say that you know it?

I'm going to share with you some ways to use mnemonic (memory) techniques to learn chants, suttas, and Buddhist teachings. These memory techniques can actually be used to easily memorise anything, but the real power isn't just in the ability to instantly recall whatever you want whenever you want it, or impress your kalyāna mitta by spontaneously rattling off a verse from the Dhammapada. The real power is in the way that they unleash your creative potential and have you using your mind in ways that you never thought possible.

These techniques will change the way you learn and the way you understand the Dhamma. They will open up a new dimension to the suttas, as you see that the Buddha had a deep understanding of mnemonics when he structured the whole pitaka as a mnemonic fractal (more about that later). If you learn how to use mnemonic devices and get familiar with oral recitation, bringing memory work into your practice, you're aligning yourself with the teachings of the Buddha in the way the ancients used to learn it. It's like a secret code hidden in plain sight.

Enough of the sales pitch. Let's get into it. 

I'm going to break this down into simple parts. I'll be referencing a few techniques throughout and giving a little synopsis of each one as we go, with links to do further reading as you wish. The intention with this article is to give you a practical scaffolding by which to learn a teaching, a chant (or a sutta, or whatever you want). I'll share the memory techniques that I've found most beneficial, but there are many different ways to do this, so if you find yourself intrigued by a certain aspect of the work, I encourage you to go digging for different ways.

When you learn about memory, you're actually learning about how the mind works, as memory is a product of the mind.  

Here's an exercise: Close your eyes, and try and recall your first mobile phone number. Now close them again and try to recall a bedroom you used to have as a child, and maybe an object in that room.  

Which could you recall? I bet it was the room. 

Why is that? 

It's because the mind remembers things that are spatial and image based. This is built into our language too, when we say words like 'image-inary'. The mind also likes sounds, as in music and phonetic sounds, which is why we love music and when we meditate we sometimes get a random song from Cold Chisel suddenly popping into our head. This means that we can remember images, spaces (as in landscapes or rooms), and certain sounds, much more easily than say, numbers, or words. We can remember a room from long ago, but not the name of a person we met two minutes ago. 

There could be evolutionary reasons for this, such as the need for the human being to be able to recognise landmarks (images) as we walked through a landscape (space) and listened to our environment in order to scan for potential dangers (sounds). Whatever the reasons, this is how the mind is built, and knowing this means we can leverage that aspect of the mind to be able to remember things - we can work with how the mind works, rather than against it.  

In order to work with the mind, we use memory techniques. Memory techniques basically work by creating images associated with what you want to remember, and placing them in a space, because as we've seen above, the memory likes images and spaces. All memory techniques come down to these two things - generating images, and places those images in a space. When we want to recall a piece of information, the mind will very quickly be able to access the image in the space - think of it as a kind of interior library that you can create in your own mind. 

To walk you through how to do this, I'm going to use a simple example of a Buddhist teaching that we can learn together. I'll be getting you to generate the images and placing them in a location as we go, so you can see how easy it is to do this, and how powerful it can be. 

We're going to learn the seven awakening factors, in both Pāli (the Indo-Aryan language used to preserve the early Buddhist texts) and English. The seven awakening factors are a classic list of qualities that are developed on the path to awakening. 

**Our Palace**

The first thing we need is a space to put our images. This is known as a [memory palace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4J5ZUzCxZY). A memory palace is essentially a room, or a series of rooms in a house, or a series of buildings with rooms (like your old highschool for example) or a landscape. It's good to use a space you have been to in real life and are somewhat familiar with. The good thing is that there are *tons* of these available, because we have been moving in and out of lots of buildings and landscapes all through our life. Anywhere you've visited is a potential palace. You can use other things for palaces too, like your body, or mandalas, or geometrical patterns. There are lots of possibilities.

For now, let's imagine a room. I'll let you choose the room, but if you're stuck, just use the childhood bedroom from earlier. 

Close your eyes and take a moment to really visualise the room - pretend you are in it and try and get a feeling for the space, cast your mind's eye across the walls, floor, and ceiling. Take note of the light, the textures, where the door and windows are. Use your senses and see if you can even smell the room, or hear any sounds associated with it. Take note of furniture or objects in the room, pick them up, run your hand over them and feel them. None of this needs to be perfect, just see what comes up. 

Ok, that's our palace.

**Our Images**

We're going to memorise the seven awakening factors in Pāli, called 'bojjhaṅga' (pronounced bo-jan-gah). While we're at it, let's memorise the word bojjhaṅga as well. 

Here's the list:

> bojjhaṅga (bo-jan-gah) - awakening factors:
> sati (sah-ti) - mindfulness  
> dhammavicaya (dum-a-wi-cha-ya) - investigation of Dhamma  
> viriya (wi-ri-yah) - energy  
> pīti (pee-tee) - rapture  
> passaddhi (pa-sah-dee) - tranquillity
> samādhi (sa-mah-dee) - stillness  
> upekkhā (oo-peh-kah) - equanimity  

I've include the phonetic sounds because they help us not only pronounce words correctly, but they can be used to generate images, as we will see shortly. 

There are many ways to generate images. I'm going to show you a simple method called [association](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4J5ZUzCxZY). You can just stick with association, as once you get familiar with it, it's lots of fun, but if you want to branch out, there are many others which you can experiment with [here](https://artofmemory.com/blog/list-of-memory-techniques/#2-mnemonic-image-method).

What makes a good image? A good images is one that you will easily remember. In creating images, try and think of something that is - funny, scary, shocking, risqué, taboo, weird, violent, naughty... you get the idea. Make it interesting, and be as creative as you like. The more you do this, the more you'll learn about what sticks to your mind. 

When we create images we want to all our senses to engage with the image. We want to not only imagine what the image looks like, but touch it, hear it, taste it, or smell it. The more senses we use in trying to connect with the object, the more it will sink into our neural network. Use bright colours, strong smells and tastes, distinctive shapes and textures. Play around. 

Ok let's create out first image. Let's start with the name for the awakening factors themselves - bojjhaṅga. 

When I say the word 'bojjhaṅga', the way it sounds, 'bo-jan-gah', reminds me of an african drummer. So I could use an African drummer beating a big drum, one beat for every syllable, chanting the word over and over, 'bo-jan-gah, bo-jan-gah'. He might have colourful African tribal clothing. I can smell his sweat as he's getting worked up drumming. I can imagine his sweat would be salty to taste, and he is slippery to the touch. I could remember bojjhaṅga means 'awakening' in English by having his eyes open wide looking straight at me, like he is wide awake. 

That's all a bit weird to start thinking like that, but I guarantee you will remember it. These images are like little triggers for the mind to remember. Place your drummer at the entrance to your room and see him there, almost like he is drumming you into entering into the room with a rolling drum beat. 

First word done. 

Let's do one more word, and I'll let you do the rest. Next is sati, pronounced 'sah-tee', which means mindfulness in English. Does any image come to mind? You can use the word itself, sati, which kinda sounds like 'sat', and rhymes with 'cat'. 'Tee' could be a t-shirt, or a cup of tea. Why not both? To remember that sati means 'mindfulness' we could use the image of a brain (or a heart if you associate the mind with the heart). 

Let's make the second image a psychedelic orange Garfield cat wearing a t-shirt with the letter 'T' on the front, holding up a cup of tea. He can have the top of his head cut-off so you can see his brain throbbing. He's sitting on the floor to the left of the door. 

You see how this works? See if you can do the rest and place them around the room. Spend a little time playing around with the phonetic sounds, and see if any images come to mind. The weirder the better. 

When you're done, zoom around the room from beginning to end, and say the names as you go, seeing, feeling, sensing the images as best you can. 

That's your first memory palace done.

Now, this may all seem like a lot of work. You may even feel a little zapped after doing your first palace. That's totally normal, this is a faculty of your mind that you probably haven't used much before and initially it will take effort to come up with these rooms, images, and associations. At the start, this new way of learning will seem clunky and a little awkward, and you may find yourself spending more time than you like getting the hang of it, but that's the same with any new thing that we learn though, no?

The more you do it, the more fluid and seamless you will become. It will be very natural to come up with images on the fly and you can apply this to all sorts of areas of your life, with anything you want to remember, whether it's chanting, names of people and their family members, Pāli grammar, whatever. The more you do it, the more you'll amaze yourself with how creative you can be, and you'll learn about your own mind and what sticks in your memory and why. 

I learn chanting by memorising by rote a stanza, and then I stitch the stanzas together in a memory palace, using the first word of the stanza to trigger an image. This way each stanza is an image, and I never get lost in a chant 'cos I know where I am in the room. If you want to get fancy, you can recite the chant in reverse order, or jump around the room and recite stanzas in random order, as this will embed the associations even deeper in your mind.

This leads me to the last section. I want to touch on the powerful potential of these practices, in particular for a practical understanding of the Dhamma.

When I started to learn more about mnemonics, I was immediately struck by just how much of what I was learning was so obviously baked into the suttas. This makes total sense of course, as the Dhamma was preserved at first in an oral culture at the time of the Buddha. It would make sense that the practitioners of that time used certain mnemonic devices to remember and organise the teachings.

We can see this when we see the liberal use of numbers in the Dhamma. The Buddha makes lists of factors, and uses numbers to organise them. The Buddha also uses striking similes, which are essentially images, to highlight teachings, and which aid in memory. These similes are often associated with stock passages in the canon, which is another layer of embedded association. There is also a lot of repetition in the suttas, which would have been helpful in memorisation. The Pāli language itself is beautifully lyrical and lends well to assimilation and rhyme, and the cadence and rhythm of core passages have a lyrical and almost song-like quality to them, which of course connects to the mind's love of sound.

The structure of the canon itself, could also be described as fractal. A fractal is a mathematically generated geometrical shape, like the Mandelbrot set. Most fractals have some sort of self-similarity, which means that you continue to see the same shapes and patterns as you continue to zoom in. Check it out an example [here](https://xaos-project.github.io/). This structure is very different from a Cartesian or linear model, and I suspect that it's very intentional as it dovetails neatly with mnemonics, which can also be used in this way. 

When you build memory palaces you will quickly find that you can link them together in any number of ways. Let's say you make a memory palace called 'eightfold path'. It's a large building with eight rooms - one for each of the factors of the eightfold path - that you want to use to remember teachings for each factor. The first room contains images associated with aspects of the first factor of the eightfold path - right view, otherwise known as the four noble truths. As you fill out the room with the images, you come to the last section,  the fourth noble truth, and realise you are looking at... the eightfold path.  

Do you see what's going on here? You're in a memory palace for the eightfold path, in a room for right view, looking at... the eightfold path again. You've zoomed in to a part of the pattern only to realise that it's recursive, like a fractal. 

The whole pitaka is structured like this. 

This means that you can get creative and link different rooms together not in a linear way, but like a fractal. In our example above, maybe the last image in the four truths room to remember the eightfold path was a doll house with eight rooms. As you lean over to look into the dollhouse you look into the first room and see yourself looking into a dollhouse, or maybe you just want to skip to the eight factor on samādhi and rather than move through the house you're in, you just teleport into the dollhouse in front of you and go from there. The options are endless, and you're only limited by your imagination. This way of learning is so much fun, and engaging, and it makes the Dhamma come alive 'cos you're not only working with how the mind remembers, but you're now working with how the Dhamma is structured for you to remember. You'll come up with all sorts of new associations through approaching the Dhamma this way, and I can't help but feel that *that is the point* - to expand our mind and see and perceive things in new ways. 

Have fun ;)

- Peace.
