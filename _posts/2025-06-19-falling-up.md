At some point you have to be able to sit in your hut and just breathe. 

You have this idea that to be a real monk, all you must do is just walk and sit, walk and sit, like that is all the practice is, just staying in that space and cultivating samādhi. 

Even if it were true, could you do it? 

The mind keeps spinning out to all these other options and you don't feel like it's ever going to stop. 

The loneliness feels suffocating, and there are days in which you feel like every waking moment, the callousness of the people in robes around you, is grating on your heart. These people seem like maniacs, their egos boiling away, and it's all you can do not to fast and scream. 

Are you able to just walk away from all of this? To endure going back into you room and being by yourself and letting the silence envelop you, nothing to turn to except your mind, your body, your breath? Intrinsically you know that this is what it will take, and you must not only be able to do it, but to maintain this kind of practice, day after day, kneading into the moment, searching deeper, falling up. 

When the bliss takes hold it is clear that the path is easy to those who stay with the practice always, enduring all the myriad ways the mind tries to derail itself. Those freaky little sideshows are worth it when the time comes for the mind to open up. When it's like that it doesn't matter what all the ass-clowns around you are hooting at; they're lost little boys torturing insects. You don't judge yourself either, the path is a field around you, flowing, filled with mettā and goodness.  

This is the right kind of emptiness. It's not a vacant, unfeeling hardness,  masquerading as a monk; it's the warm glow of an inner peace that lubricates the mind and embalms all the facets of consciousness, washing through you like rain so that stillness is simply the natural consequence. 

It is *this* space that one needs to cultivate, as this is the only thing that is true and good. It's just that to know that one cannot rely on anything else, is large, and hurts to bear. It is a grief that must be endured though because you see that most people in this life don't make it. They don't have the faith, or the endurance, or the heart. One must find happiness in this bhikkhu life, as it is full of challenges, and the joy is all we have to keep us going. 

If one finds oneself in moments of quiet desperation, one must know that we choose this hardship no matter what, and that really there is no other way, no other way than this. 

It doesn't matter if I don't make it. I need to try. I will rise each day, grateful for the challenge. There are no guarantees that any of this is real. All the bravado around me is just that, empty words, the prattle of people that need it, to soothe their fears. It's enough to take stock of the way oneself and commit to walking it, alone if need be, but likely with a few friends along the way. 

The way forward - inward. It's time to become your own man and make this path into the way of life that you came here for. Put down everything else and make it yours. Commit to this path and bring it into your heart and let the softer aspects your your nature sing. 

It's time. 


- Peace.
