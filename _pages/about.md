### The Short

Kimbila is a Buddhist monk with a focus on meditation and writing. He meditates in a small room that looks out on to a scrubby forest where kangaroos sometimes stare at him through his window as they munch grass.  

This is his blog. 

### The Long

I was born in Perth, Australia. When I was little my family moved up north to a wild region called the Kimberley. The Kimberley is about three times the size of England, except that no-one lives there.

When we first arrived my Mum took me to a riverbank where I sat between her legs and splashed my feet in the water. It was only later that we found out that the mud slicks we'd seen leading into the water next to us were crocodile tracks and that splashing tends to attract crocodiles. 

Surviving such things, I grew until I was a skinny six foot, and many years later I went to the University of Sydney where I studied design and got up to the usual mischief. When I left university I squatted in abandoned inner city houses and read incessantly, and in my wanderings met a lady who introduced me to meditation. 

I must have liked meditation because a few years later I became a Buddhist monk. Then a few years after that I disrobed. Then I few years after that I came back to the monastery. I can't seem to stay away from this Buddhism thing. 

I'm very blessed. I live in a monastery with an amazing teacher named Ajahn Brahm and a beautiful community of people that smile a lot. Monastic life isn't always easy but I love it. On any given day I serve the community, and then I get to spend my free time meditating and enjoying the stillness. When I'm not doing that, I write a bit. 

This blog is called 'Kimbila on Toast', 'cos I like toast; just like the Dhamma, it reminds me of home.
