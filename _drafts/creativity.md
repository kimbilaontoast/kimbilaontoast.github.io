An approach I'm choosing to take with these posts moving forward is not to spent too much time on polish - but to simply get into the habit of writing regularly and freely. 

The CIA has nothing on the monastic grapevine. 

Something happens to people when they spend a lot of time together. There is an inevitable smalling of the world around you - you see the same people, the same faces, hear the same voices and opinions and concerns. This shapes you and after a while you begin to echo back what you see and hear and feel from those around you. 

This is why it's so important to be circumspect with the kind of people you let into your life. It may seem like monastics are people that have their lives together, but anyone who has spent any amount of time in a monastery, or on the periphery of supporting one, will tell you it attracts all kinds of colourful cats, with all kinds of motvies and all kinds of lives. 

Socrates once said that there are three people that live on the margins of society - the crimminal, the insane, and the wise. In Buddhist monsateries you often have them living side by side and it's something that blindsides you when you come and spend time in what you naievly intially think will be a nice, peaceful place, with nice, pleasant people, acting in nice, stable ways. 

So much for that. 

Saying all this, I think I've landed in one of the best monasteries in the world, frankly. Bodhinyana is a very kind place, and this has been modelled by Ajahn Brahm, who exemplifies kindness in almost every waking moment. That's a huge lesson is how to conduct oneself in community. Something that becomes apparent very quicly is that it's not about having to like everybody, it's about learning to love and respect everybody. It's unrealistic to expect that you will like everyone in a community of random people. In Australia things are complicated even more because we live in a diverse and multicultural society and so there are different expectations surrounding behaviour and cultural norms through the Buddhist lens, and when these things overlap they can conflict. I sometimes marvel at the fact that somehow it all just kind of works, it's a testament to the power of kindness and compassion to see how much of a social glue those intentions really can be when practiced. 

Coming back to to privacy though, which is why I really started writing this post. There is a fishbowl effect that happens in monastic communities. It's probably the same for any kind of institution that has people living in the same quarters for any length of time, like the army, or jail. It's a challenge to keep one's mind big - the mind had a tendency to become small and petty, to start to nit-pick and focus on the sleight faults in the people around us, to amplify these things as being somehow important when really they are just trivial. If this calcifies into long-term behaviour patterns, then people can become almost like spies, policing others around them and measuring themselves by what they are not, rather than what they are. This was highlighted by a talk some years ago by Bhante Sujato, a senior monastic that spent some of his formative years training at Bodhinyana.

What happens to the mind of a man or woman that spends too long staring at the same people across the room, day in, day out? If you haven't got anything else going on in your life, that becomes your life. You start to measure yourself against the touchstone of your perceptions of other people, rather than using the path to motivate you to change your own behaviour. 

As renunciants we are taught to renounce. Obviously this is a good thing; we are training to move away for concern with sensuality and all that householder life entails. However sometimes I think that in it's modern form Western Theravada buddhism is missing something. Ajahn Nisabho talks of the Jungian idea of eros and thanos, which are the creative and destructive impulse of humans. 

I think what happens when we enter monastic life is that we are very familiar with the renunciant message; it's why we are here, and it's rewarded. However there is often very little room for the concept of the creative in Western Buddhism. Creative works are seen as a distraction, a 'worldy' activity, something that is tengential to the path, an obstruction. This flie in the face of the culture of Buddhism we see in Asian countries, which is replete with all fomrs of creativity, and even the suttas themselves, which contain the earliest wildeness poetry we have on record. In modern Western Buddhism, we have placed an emphasis on the suttas, we have sophisticated tools for doing comparative studies across the recensions of many differnt languages and schools of Buddhism, we are penetrating the early Buddhist texts (EBTs) and there is an exciting deepening of our understanding of what the Buddha taught and the cultural milieu in which these teachings were given which is breathing new life into our religion. Howver I can't help but see that our focus is selective -  tending to focus on the academic and the doctrinal, rather than the lives of those living in these suttas, their stories and struggles, their verse and expression, their humour and often comical, paradoxical, and conflicted humanity. 

This is reflected in the modern form that our Buddhism is taking in the West - we relegate stories to the shadows, under the post-colonial rubric of games for children, whilst we celebrate the crowning achievement of our modern, scienific, rational conquering of the primitive.

Is this really the Buddhism we want? Do we want some dry, ossified, souless beige version of the Dhamma? 

How this plays out is already screamingly obvious to anyone who pays attention to the dynamics in Western monasteries. If eros, or the creative impulse, is relegated to the shadows, and thanos takes it's place, then what that looks like is the solution is always more renunciation. This renunciation is often forced, not natural, becuase the energy that would normally be allowed to flow into channels of expression and output has to go somewhere, and that force results in a kind of dry, joyless asceticism. It's not even true asceticism because true renunciation happens naturally, and is consistent, so that one's private and public spheres are basically the same. If there is a social expectation for letting go and people aren't ready, the social pressure to conform creates a pantomime of moansicism where on the surface people make a show of simplicity, but actually live privately very stimulated and complicated lives. This may involve tablets and podcasts. Too much sugar and caffeine may be consumed. And so on. 

Can we make space for the creative act within our emerging culture of Buddhism as it moves into more traditionally 'western' parts of the world like Australia, America, and Europe? What would that look like?

I often wonder whether the early monks and nuns at the time of the Buddha were much more free-style than we give them credit for. The Buddha is a master of metaphor, there is nothing even close in the human record that matches the genius of the similes and allegory used in the suttas. The Theragatha and Therigatha contain beautiful peotry that often not only crystallises moments on the path of practice, but gives us insight into the humans practicing and their connection not only the the Dhamma of the teaching, but the Dhamma of nature itself, their connection to country and the life that teems within. 

We are currently living ona dying planet. We've done a pretty good job of trashing it in the last fifty years especially. The same impulse to destruction that lies wihin our private lives plays our on the public stage - when we sever our connection to spirit, to the land and the life around us, when we inflict violence on ourselves and mistake it for noble intention, then we are bound to miss the mark, to 'sin' as it is said in the Christian tradition, and cause suffering for not only ourselves, but all around us.

As monastics we have a beautiful opportunity to be living proof that a differnt way of life is possible, that we don't have to live a life of consumption and endlessly appealing to satisfying our every desire. But consumption isn't creativity, and destruction isn't renunciation. These are differnet things, and I wonder whether we've been so conditioned to view life through the prism of acquisition and loss, that we miss the mark on what the Buddha was talking about with these terms. Renunciation doesn't imply that we let go of our creative impulse, it simply means that we let go of interest in the five sense world. The creative force can be a way of celebrating that journey, and used not only for inspiration, but for elucidation, as we have seen by the finest exaple of the Buddha himself, whose creativity left a legacy of some of the most lucid teaching, some of the most brilliant allegory and similes, and the most powerful and awe-inspiring view of the world. 

In his search before his awakening, Siddartha was a young man that was deeply engaged with, and sensitive to, the word around him. A man that was questioning the deeper realities of life and not shying away from their consequence, a man that was on a search for something that had as yet in his time, been discovered. The brevity to do that is startling, and I can only wonder at the qualities of mind one must possess to be able to break through on the path for oneself. Sutrely that would require marshalling all the forces of the human mind and putting it's full potential forward, and that includes creativity. We have that on record with the similes etc. 

I want to live in a world in which creativity in celbrated in the monastic scene, in which creatives are celebrated in the monastic scene. Creativity and creative expression isn't anaethema to the path, it's not a useless and fruitless waste of time, a distraction, and obstruction. That's the rhetoric of boring people, and we have enough of those. Let's use the creative force in the mind and put it to the path, to help us solve our dilemmas laterally, and help us inspire those around us with beauty.
