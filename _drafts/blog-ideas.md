## Blog ideas 

What do you want the blog to be?

I like the idea of it being like a journal - spilling your mind onto the page in the only way you know how - raw, open, brutally honest. 

If it's a journal type blog, then it means you can be honest and explore whatever - all these themes that come to mind can be worked into the blog and you can talk about them within the context of your own journey. You can also tell stories and whatever really, because you have permissiont to explore whatever, it's like a mind-dump which is boh your own chronicle and something that people can track.
