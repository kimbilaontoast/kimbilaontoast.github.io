Do you have the gall to surrender, mind?  
Can you go so deep inside, that all the glitter and razzmatazz, ceases not just to seduce, but to be?  
You’ve come to *nekkhamma*, but how much can you truly leave behind? 

You’ve stepped this body into the forest, without possessions, or money.  
Giving up a meaningful trade, you seek no recognition in roles.   
Letting go of friends and lovers, even family; your life is fading like a bleached memory.  

You’ve made some strong choices in coming here, haven't you?  
You’ve banished *Māra's* toys of deception - things you said you’d leave behind.  
Yet you seek out other measures, to distract, and blame. 

I watch you lurch out in vain, in cloying need to bleed into something, anything to be seen and heard, to be felt as something real, and true.   
You want to lead me on to seas of future pain, whispering sweet, empty lies about my fake, cake life.  

You love the truth, except when it’s about you, don’t you?   
At some point you have to stop searching, and face it.    
I think you feel that death rattle closing in.

The Western mind is a disease. You’ve tricked me into thinking it worthwhile.  
You’re the chimerical pied-piper leading me on, away from my heart and into the loop of shimmering opinion, barking through my teeth when I don’t know a thing. 

Meditation is more important than anything that you’re doing.   
It’s obscene, this refusal to simply do what is said. To walk, to sit, be still.   
This doe-eyed submission is dangerous. You know this.

I can hear the soft rumble of the Buddha’s thunder in my heart.   
He crashes into me.  
You already know; the path is right before you.    

This is what it is to be a man – to live as if your father were dead.  
With fractal crumbs and clear mind, smeared with ash a thousand times, leave this maddening world behind, as it babbles and burns.  

It's your turn.
