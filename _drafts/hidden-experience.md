primal abandonment trauma

flashback to being born?

glimpse outside of our reality tunnel 
imaginal - a realm outside our senses 

with the orb, was there something spoken? a communication in that liminal space. 



UFO like a crack of light seen from inside the womb - similarity to a birth experience

atavistic memory. 
as a sperm seeing the ovum, white glowing sphere, sperm doesn't have eyes and it wants to fuse with the ovum - life will be created. 
the ufo is equivalent to primordial experiences of conception and birth - crack of light / elipsis and the orb being drawn towards - we get taken inside the orb.



feminine mandala, sphere, yoni, sphere - feminine symbols 
essence of the ufo is a call to attention to the lost feminine, the mother ship to come and take us into it's womb, carry us to a new to be reborn 

ufo is an aperture that is drawing us into another reality, like love, real communion, requires passing through the other person and into another state of being
